> Codebase for Cross-Spectral Factor Analysis (Gallagher et al., 2017)

>The main functions for use in this repository are trainCSFA.m, projectCSFA.m, and saveTrainRuns.m
>First see the header documentation in those functions.

>trainCSFA expects a file containing the sets variable, which is a structure defining a train/val/test split of the data. The function saves each model in an intermediate checkpoint file that begins with 'chkpt'.
>saveTrainRuns saves all of the intermediate checkpoint files with the same train/val/test split in the same file.
